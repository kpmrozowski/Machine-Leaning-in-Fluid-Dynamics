The core algorithms are in the "utils" directory:

    poolData.m (creates nonlinear feature library "Theta")
    sparsifyDynamics (solves for sparse vector of coefficients "Xi" given data... could be replaced with LASSO command in Matlab)
    sparseGalerkin.m (computes new sparse right-hand-side function using sparse vector of coefficients "Xi")

The vector fields used are also in "utils"

Code to generate models and figures for each example (ordered as in the supplement) are given in .m files "EX01" "EX02", etc. in the main directory.

We also use some other functions that are freely available online: 

    TVRegDiff (total-variation regularized differentiation)
    color_line3 (changes color of line by specified value)
